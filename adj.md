# Adjectives

Most adjectives match their noun in gender and number. 

*Cappello* is masculine, so "the black hat" is *il cappello nero*, and "the black hats" becomes *i cappelli neri*. 

Shoe is feminine, so the adjectives change to *la scarpa bianca* and *le
scarpe bianche*.


    spiacente     sorry
