    in  in
    a   to

    nel libro   in the book

Words such as *in* (in) or *a* (to) are followed by articles like *il, lo, la, le, gli* they become one word. To say "in the" you would not use *in il* or *in lo*, but rather *nel* or *nello*. 

For example, you say *nel libro* and not *in il libro*.
